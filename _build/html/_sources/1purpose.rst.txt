Purpose
#######

This plan establishes policy and assigns responsibilities for the portion of Firm’s personnel reliability program that applies to its contractually obligated Insider Threat Program (ITP).

The ITP establishes a secure operating baseline for personnel, facilities, information, equipment, networks, or systems from insider threats.

An insider threat is defined as "the likelihood, risk or potential that an insider will use his or her authorized access, wittingly or unwittingly to do harm to the security of the United States."

Insider threats may include harm to Firm or program information to the extent that the information impacts the firm or agency’s obligations to protect classified national security information.

The program will gather, integrate, and report relevant and credible information covered by the 13 personnel security adjudicative guidelines that may be indicative of a potential or actual insider threat to deter all Firm employees granted personnel clearances (PCLs) and all employees being processed for PCLs, from becoming insider threats; detect any cleared person with authorized access to any government or Firm resources to include personnel, facilities, information, equipment, networks, or systems, who pose a risk to classified information; and mitigate the risk of an insider threat as defined above.
