The ITP will be established to protect personnel, facilities, and automated systems from insider threats in compliance with DoD 5220.22-M *National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM)*.

This program will seek to prevent espionage, violent acts against the Nation or the unauthorized disclosure of classified information; deter cleared employees from becoming insider threats; detect employees who pose a risk to classified information systems and classified information; and mitigate the risks to the security of classified information through administrative, investigative, or other responses.

The ITP will meet or exceed the minimum standards for such programs, as defined in *NISPOM* paragraph 1-202 with additional guidance provided in Industrial Security Letter (ISL) 2016-02 and Defense Security Service (DSS) *ODAA Process Manual for Certification and Accreditation of Classified Systems under the NISPOM*.

The responsibilities outlined in :doc:`5responsibilities` are designed to enable the ITP to gather, integrate, centrally analyze, and respond appropriately to key threat-related information.

The ITP will consult with records management, legal counsel, and civil liberties and privacy officials to ensure any legal, privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties issues -- including, but not limited to, the use of personally identifiable information (PII) -- are appropriately addressed.
